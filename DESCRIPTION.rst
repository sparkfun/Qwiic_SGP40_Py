Qwiic Air Quality Sensor - SGP40
=============================================

The SparkFun SGP40 Air Quality Sensor provides a measurement of the quality of the air in your room or house. 
The SGP40 is based on Sensirions CMOS technology and uses a metal oxide (MOx) sensor with a temperature 
controlled micro hotplate and provides a humidity-compensated volatile organic compound (VOC) based indoor 
air quality signal. Both the sensing element and VOC Algorithm feature an unmatched robustness against 
contaminating gases present in real world applications enabling a unique long term stability as well as low 
drift and device to device variation.
